# Homemade-AirTag
This was my final project for my intro to engineering course at UTD. This project utilised an ESP32 and a NEO-6M GPS module to communicate to an iPhone and compare the locations of the created device and the phone. Once the distance was great enough, a discord message would be sent via webhooks into a personal server.
